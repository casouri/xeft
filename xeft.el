;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Type M-x xeft RET, and you should see the Xeft buffer. Type in your
;; search phrase in the first line and the results will show up as you
;; type. Press C-n and C-p to go through each file. You can preview a
;; file by pressing SPC when the point is on a file, or click the file
;; with the mouse. Press RET to open the file in the same window.
;;
;; Type C-c C-g to force a refresh. When point is on the search
;; phrase, press RET to create a file with the search phrase as
;; the filename and title.
;;
;; Note that:
;;
;; 1. Xeft ignores search phrases shorter than three characters,
;;    unless they are CJK characters.
;;
;; 2. Xeft only looks for first-level files in ‘xeft-directory’. Files
;;    in sub-directories are not searched unless ‘xeft-recursive’ is
;;    non-nil.
;;
;; 3. Xeft creates a new file by using the search phrase as the
;;    filename and title. If you want otherwise, redefine
;;    ‘xeft-create-note’ or ‘xeft-filename-fn’.
;;
;; 4. Xeft saves the current window configuration before switching to
;;    Xeft buffer. When Xeft buffer is killed, Xeft restores the saved
;;    window configuration.
;;
;; On search queries:
;;
;; Since Xeft uses Xapian, it supports the query syntax Xapian
;; supports:
;;
;; AND, NOT, OR, XOR and parenthesizes
;;
;; +word1 -word2      which matches documents that contains word1 but not
;;                    word2.
;;
;; word1 NEAR word2   which matches documents in where word1 is near
;;                    word2.
;;
;; word1 ADJ word2    which matches documents in where word1 is near word2
;;                    and word1 comes before word2
;;
;; "word1 word2"      which matches exactly “word1 word2”
;;
;; Xeft deviates from Xapian in one aspect: consecutive phrases have
;; implied “AND” between them. So "word1 word2 word3" is actually seen
;; as "word1 AND word2 AND word3". See ‘xeft--tighten-search-phrase’
;; for how exactly is it done.
;;
;; See https://xapian.org/docs/queryparser.html for Xapian’s official
;; documentation on query syntax.
;;
;; Further customization:
;;
;; You can customize the following faces

;; - `xeft-selection'
;; - `xeft-inline-highlight'
;; - `xeft-preview-highlight'
;; - `xeft-excerpt-title'
;; - `xeft-excerpt-body'

;; Functions you can customize to alter Xeft’s behavior:

;; - `xeft-filename-fn': How does Xeft create new files from search
;;   phrases.
;;
;; - `xeft-file-filter': Which files does Xeft include/exclude from
;;   indexing.
;;
;; - `xeft-directory-filter': When `xeft-recursive' is t, which
;;   sub-directories does Xeft include/exclude from indexing.
;;
;; - `xeft-title-function': How does Xeft find the title of a file.
;;
;; - `xeft-file-list-function': If `xeft-file-filter' and
;;   `xeft-directory-filter' are not flexible enough, this function
;;   gives you ultimate control over which files to index.
